# Phase 1 - Problem Definition & Requirements: Scam-Detector

## 📌 Project Overview
Scam-Detector is an **AI-powered tool for combating misinformation**.  
It is designed to detect, analyze, and prevent the spread of fake news, scams, and fraudulent content across digital platforms.  

The system integrates:
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Machine Learning / Neural Networks**
- **Blockchain & Cryptocurrency**
- **Cybersecurity**

Goal: Ensure that all online content is **authentic, traceable, and verifiable**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Misinformation, scams, and deepfakes are spreading at alarming rates through:
- Social media
- Online news outlets
- Blogs and forums

### Key Challenges
1. **Rapid Spread**: Information spreads faster than human fact-checking can handle.
2. **Multi-modal Data**: Fake content exists as text, images, videos, and voice.
3. **Lack of Automation**: Manual systems cannot scale to process millions of data points.
4. **Trust & Credibility**: Users cannot easily distinguish real vs fake content.
5. **Delayed Alerts**: Current systems do not provide real-time notifications for critical threats.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
The solution is a **multi-layered AI platform** that combines **real-time data processing, blockchain verification, and cybersecurity**.  

### Key Components
1. **Agent Research Layer** (Before Preprocessing)
   - Smart agents collect raw data from:
     - OSINT sources
     - Social media platforms
     - IoT devices and sensors
     - News APIs and blogs
   - Agents **research and tag information** with metadata and initial credibility assessment.
   - This ensures contextual intelligence is passed to the next layer.

2. **Preprocessing & Privacy Layer**
   - Cleans and normalizes text, audio, images, and video.
   - Removes duplicates and irrelevant content.
   - Anonymizes personal/sensitive information.
   - Supports multi-language preprocessing (English, Hindi, etc.)

3. **AI & NLP Engine**
   - NLP for text-based misinformation detection.
   - Computer Vision (CV) for image/video manipulation detection.
   - ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) for speech/audio analysis.
   - Outputs stored in a **Knowledge Graph Database** linking entities and claims.

4. **Fact Verification Module**
   - Cross-checks content against trusted databases (e.g., PolitiFact, Snopes, FactCheck.org)
   - Assigns **credibility scores** for each piece of content.

5. **Blockchain Ledger**
   - Stores verified claims **immutably**.
   - Ensures traceability and accountability.
   - Supports **crypto-based incentives** for validators.

6. **Cybersecurity Shield**
   - Detects botnets, fake accounts, phishing, and malicious traffic.
   - Uses AI anomaly detection for real-time threat monitoring.

7. **Alerting System**
   - Multi-channel alerts: dashboard, mobile apps, email, SMS.
   - Critical alerts include **red pop-ups and sound notifications**.
   - Severity levels:
     - ℹ️ Info → low-risk anomalies
     - ⚠️ Warning → potential misinformation
     - 🔴 Critical → verified scams/fraud

8. **Human-in-the-loop Review**
   - Analysts validate flagged content.
   - Feedback loop improves AI model accuracy.
