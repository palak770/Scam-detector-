# Scam-detector-
# AI-Powered Tool for Combating Misinformation

## üìå Overview
This project proposes an **AI-driven, blockchain-secured, cybersecurity-enhanced platform** to combat the spread of misinformation.  
It integrates **Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML)/ neural network , Cybersecurity, and Cryptocurrency/Blockchain** to ensure that news and content shared online is **authentic, traceable, and verifiable**.

---

## üéØ Problem Statement
Misinformation, fake news, and deepfakes are spreading rapidly through social media, news outlets, and online forums.  
This leads to:
- Social unrest and polarization.  
- Economic and political instability.  
- Loss of trust in information sources.  

Current systems rely heavily on **manual fact-checking**, which is **time-consuming and not scalable**.  
A more **automated, secure, and transparent solution** is required.

---

## üí° Proposed Solution
An **AI-powered misinformation detection and prevention tool** that uses:
- **NLP + ML/NN** to detect misinformation in real-time.  
- **Blockchain & Cryptocurrency** to ensure secure, tamper-proof, and incentivized information verification.  
- **Cybersecurity frameworks** to protect against manipulation, hacking, and bot-driven disinformation campaigns.

## üîë Core Features
1. **Real-Time Content Analysis**
   - Uses **NLP** and **deep learning models** to analyze news, posts, and multimedia for misinformation patterns.  
   - Detects **linguistic cues, sentiment, bias, and fake patterns**.

2. **Fact Verification Engine**
   - Connects to trusted **fact-checking databases & APIs**.  
   - Cross-verifies claims with multiple authentic sources.  

3. **Blockchain for Transparency**
   - Every verified news/article is **stored on blockchain** for immutability.  
   - Provides a **traceable record of authenticity**.  

4. **Crypto-Incentivized Ecosystem**
   - Fact-checkers, validators, and contributors get rewarded in tokens.  
   - Encourages community participation in truth verification.  

5. **Cybersecurity Layer**
   - Detects and blocks **botnets, fake accounts, phishing attacks** spreading misinformation.  
   - Uses **AI anomaly detection** for malicious traffic monitoring.  

6. **User-Friendly Dashboard**
   - Shows a **credibility score** for each news/article.  
   - Provides explanations: why content is flagged as real, fake, or suspicious.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
1. **Data Collection Layer**
   - Crawls data from **social media, news websites, blogs, forums**.  
2. **AI & NLP Engine**
   - Processes text, speech, and video for misinformation patterns.  
   - Uses **transformers, BERT, LSTM models**.  
3. **Fact Verification Module**
   - Matches against **fact-checking DBs** and trusted sources.  
4. **Blockchain Ledger**
   - Immutable record of verified content.  
5. **Crypto Reward System**
   - Smart contracts for rewarding validators.
